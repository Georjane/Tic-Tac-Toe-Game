## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
<h3 align="center"> This is an assignment for the Microverse course. The goal of this project is to create a Tic Tac Toe game using the programming language Ruby. The game works inside the console. Each number (1 to 9) corresponds to a position on the board. When one of the players reaches a win condition (3 consecutive symbols - X or O ) the game says who the winner is.</h3>

### üõ† How to Play <a name = "play"></a>

```
- The first player will control the X pieces, the second player the O pieces
- The first player can choose from 1 to 9
- Those numbers correspond to a position in the board
- The second player can choose after from 1 to 9, but can't choose a place that already have a piece on it.
- The game goes until any player can have a sequence of 3 pieces (rows, columns or diagonals)
- Sometimes can be a draw!

- Good game and have fun!!!

```

### Rules

```
RULES FOR TIC-TAC-TOE
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.

The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.

When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.

In this virtual implementation, you and your friend can place a mark by selecting from the numbers 1 to 9 when prompted. This is illustrated below:

| (1) | (2) | (3) |
| (4) | (5) | (6) |
| (7) | (8) | (9) |

A winning position would like the image below at the end. As soon as someone gets three of their marks in a row, the game ends.

| O | X | O |
| X | X | X | --- Player 'X' wins with this row!
| O | O | O |

For a detailed explanation, please have a look at this guide.
```

## Testing

```
To test the code, run rspec from root of the folder using terminal as follows
